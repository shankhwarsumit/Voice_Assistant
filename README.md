# Voice Assistant Project

This is a simple voice assistant project that uses speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis to interact with users. The voice assistant can perform various tasks based on user input, such as providing information, telling jokes, playing songs, and more.

## Features

- **Voice Interaction:** The voice assistant can understand and respond to voice commands.
- **Task Execution:** It can perform tasks like telling jokes, providing the current time, playing songs, and more.
- **Speech Recognition:** Utilizes the `speech_recognition` library to capture and interpret user speech.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Employs the `pyttsx3` library for converting text responses into speech.
- **External Libraries:** Integrates with libraries like `webbrowser`, `datetime`, and `pyjokes`.
